# Coding Exercises

Welcome to the Coding Exercises directory. Here you will find samples of code that do useful or interesting things that make data handling easier and quicker. Feel free to add your own examples.

## How to use these resources in RStudio:

1. Make sure you have a course directory on your desktop.
2. Go to the github repository and click the green CLONE OR DOWNLOAD button, choose HTTPS, and copy the address.
3. Open RStudio, create a New Project
  * Choose VERSION CONTROL
    * Choose GIT
      * paste the copied link from github in the Repository URL box, browse for the course directory folder, click Open in a new session.
4. Create Project. This should download all of the code in this directory including this README file.

### Important: Remember to PULL all changes every time you open the project by clicking the blue down arrow in the upper right panel in RStudio. This will make sure you have access to all of the most current versions of code and files.

## How to upload your own code to Github from RStudio:

1. Create your new R script and save it in the cloned course directory on your computer.
2. Click the Git tab in the upper right window of RStudio.
3. Click the box next to the code file you just wrote.
4. Click Commit.
5. Add your name and date to the Commit Message box.
6. Click Commit
7. Click the green up arrow to Push your change to Git. This will ask you for your Github username and password.

### Or, you can upload files directly to Github on the website.


### Here are the rules for adding code to this directory:
1. Include your own made up sample data that does not require a imported dataset.
2. List all required libraries at the beginning of the file.
3. Use comments for each line of code.
